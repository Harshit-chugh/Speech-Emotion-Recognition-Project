# Speech-Emotion-Recognition


Speech emotion recognition is a challenging task in the field of machine learning. In this study, we propose a deep learning-based approach for speech emotion recognition using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

Run the provided notebook in Jupyter notebook or you can use google collab but you will need to download the zip file and extract all datasets stored in it to run the code.
